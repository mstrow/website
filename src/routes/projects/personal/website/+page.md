# Personal Website

This website was written with Sveltekit, Typescript and SCSS.

It is a fork of file.community's website. Github repo here: https://github.com/files-community/Website

It is built using Sveltekit using the vite adapter, building to a generic node index.js file.

It runs on a Ubuntu VPC and uses [Pm2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PM2_(software)) to manage the node.
