# Final Project report

## Abstract
Exploration of an upgrade solution for a legacy IT software and infrastructure system that 
creates and manages data for multiple refuse weigh-bridge sites. The existing solution uses an 
outdated and unsecure version of SSH for file transfer of Microsoft Access database files. The 
software uses hard-coded, absolute paths for file retrieval and navigation; making solution
location specific on the systems it is located on.

Planning for partial or full migration of said software and infrastructure system to a modern
Microsoft Azure cloud-based solution, utilising SaaS, and IaaS for a more reliable and secure 
approach. Modification of Microsoft Access database files to make them location agnostic. 
Allowing the possibility of a previously fixed system to be located and accessed by Microsoft 
Azure cloud-based services and authenticated users. Changing the Access file communication 
method via the internet to a modern and secure method using said Azure solution.

The testing of modifications made to said Access database files and legacy Weighbridge 
software interactions with Azure cloud-based file storage. Discovering limitations with desired 
approach and modifications of said approach. Revised planning, testing, and eventual 
documentation of discovered alternative approaches that still fit with the original project goals. 
Creation of a deployment plan, acknowledging potential issues that may arise and 
considerations made to possible backup solutions. Allocation of time for bug fixing and issue 
amendment before full deployment.

In the end, conclusions, and reflection of the progress on the project and what changes would 
be made to the approach given the findings discovered. Also, considerations for how the project 
could continue going forward to achieve more of the initial goals, given more time.
